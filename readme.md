# Andre with Tailwind

## Installation

I'm using Laravel for these examples. For me, it was the fastest way to get Tailwind CSS running.

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
1. `composer install`
1. Rename or copy `.env.example` file to `.env`
1. `php artisan key:generate`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev` or `npm run watch`
1. `php artisan serve` or use Laravel Valet or Laravel Homestead
1. Visit `localhost:8000` in your browser

## If you're not using Laravel

Check out the [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) on how to get setup in your environment.
